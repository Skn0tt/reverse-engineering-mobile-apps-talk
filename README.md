# Reverse Engineering Mobile Apps

This talk was inspired by my experience at the [2020 BVG Hackathon](http://bvg-hackathon.de), where our team worked on a carbon-footprint dashboard for public transport.
In order to obtain the required data, we needed to reverse-engineer the API of Jelbi, a multimodal routing application deployed in Berlin.
